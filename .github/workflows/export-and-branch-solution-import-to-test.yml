# This Workflow:
# Exports Power Apps $DEFAULTSOLUTIOfrom $DEVENVURL dataverse dev environment
# Create a development branch based on Main
# Checks unpacked solution in to dev branch
# rebuilds on $BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_URL build envirnment serer
# imports managed $DEFAULTSOLUTION to $TEST_ENVIRONMETN_URL dataverse test environment
# Create a pull request on the Development branch to check back into MAIN
# to push to $PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_URL,  Create a new Release, which will kick off the Release-Action
